                <p>Virtue Method was born with the understanding that there are tight budgets in non-profit organizations, and many times, volunteers buy software with their own money. We've been there.<br>Our desire is provide really affordable software that meets your needs.<br><br>Let's do this together. This is the Virtue Method.</p>

                <h2>Slide Schedule Pro</h2>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Our first app came out of a need to schedule slides for different days and times of the week. We became frustrated loading one show for Sunday, then stopping it to load up another slideshow for Wednesday - repeat every week. Don't forget to delete that old slide! Some slides were used in both presentations - don't forget to delete both! There had to be a better way.</p>
                <p>We looked far and wide for an app that met our needs - nothing. So we decided to write our own.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Slide Schedule Pro lets you import an image as a slide, and schedule it any day, any time - you can expire it too! Click the link below to check it out.</p>
